[28 November 2011]
"Revolution" has reached version 1.0.0a. Although the most powerful algorithms have yet to be implemented, you can try optimizing any function you can think of.The current version supports single-threaded execution only, and a basic adaptive evolution strategy. No support for multi-objective problems yet.  

[15 October 2011]
"Revolution" is (will be) an API for optimization of single & multi-objective real-valued functions. The API will be written in C++. The main
features of the API will be:

1. Run optimization tasks for single objective real-valued functions using adaptive evolution strategies like CMA-ES. 
2. Combine evolution strategy algorithms with multi-objective genetic algorithms like NSGA-II & SPEA-2 to optimize 
    real-valued multi-objective functions. 

The API will be written in ANSI C++.  I would like to keep things as simple as possible, and not use any third party library. However, a possible candidate 
is Boost, since it offers a good RNG, and a way to expose functionality through python. It also offers code testing capabilities.  I haven't made up my mind 
about the build system and the library license, though we will probably use cmake and a Boost compatible license.
