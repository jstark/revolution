Building from Source
--------------------
To build from source, do a readonly checkout from github at:

git clone git://github.com/jstark/revolution.git -b revolution_1.0

The stable branch is named revolution_1.0. See "Contact Info" below for access to a readwrite checkout. The build system is based on cmake. After checking out the source code, create a 'build' directory, cd to it, and type 

                            cmake ../ 

for a simple build configuration. Typing then:

                            make 

will build the library. Typing 'make doc' will build the documentation, and 'make test' will run a couple of tests. On Windows with Visual Studio, cmake will create a VS solution which you can use to build the library and subprojects.

Documentation
-------------
"Revolution" uses Doxygen for its documentation system. If you don't have doxygen, check the http://anvilofcode.wordpress.com for the project's documentation and user's guide.
